# Enchanted Forest

My assignment will be based on an enchanted forest simulation. It will contain colorful wisps and spirits implementing various steering behaviours such as path following
and wander. As well as that I plan to have various animal lifeforms like elks and fish within the simulation running completely autonoumsly.

# Assignment Details

The camera will follow a path, showcasing the forest, eventually stopping allowing the user to free roam! this is a magical forest with
wisps implementing behaviours like flocking, path following and wandering. global volume was used for the effects and the terrain was generated
with unity's terrain component. this is mostly a forest simulation and I'm most proud of the visuals and effects used to create a cool looking
forest.

## Behaviuours
- Deer following a set path
- 3 coloured wisps (aqua, blue and green) following a different path together using path following
- Spawner spawns yellow wisps wandering using jitter wander and constrain
- Pink Wisps moves in flocks using a flocking behaviour implemented myself with lecture notes as a guide
- fish in lake using state machine to jump every few seconds implemented by myself
- camera implements path following, then free movement camera when finished
- wisps follow pink orb in a sphere

## visuals
- Using global volume for glow effect
- particle trails of all wisps
- fog around the entire map (same for used for flowers but different color)
- portal using image, particle effects
- yellow wisps floating all around the map (not the wandering ones)
- dark green wisps near trees using particle effects
- downloaded assets like rain, waterfall and sound effects used
- terrain generator used, with downloaded assets for moving grass
