# Enchanted Forest

My assignment will be based on an enchanted forest simulation. It will contain colorful wisps and spirits implementing various steering behaviours such as path following
and wander. As well as that I plan to have various animal lifeforms like elks and fish within the simulation running completely autonoumsly.
